"""
You are given two arrays A and B consisting of N integers each.
Index K is named fair if the four sums (A[0] + ... + A[K-1]), (A[K] + ... + A[N-1]), (B[0] + ... + B[K-1]) and 
(B[K] + ... + B[N-1]) are all equal. In other words, K is the index where the two arrays, A and B, can be split 
(into two non-empty arrays each) in such a way that the sums of the resulting arrays' elements are equal.
For example, given arrays A = [0, 4, -1, 0, 3] and B = [0, -2, 5, 0, 3], index K = 3 is fair. The sums of the 
subarrays are all equal: 0 + 4 + (-1) = 3; 0 + 3 = 3; 0+(-2) + 5 = 3 and 0 + 3 = 3. On the other hand, index 
K = 2 is not fair; the sums of the subarrays are: 0 + 4 = 4; (-1) + 0 + 3 = 2; 0+(-2) = -2 and 5 + 0 + 3 = 8.
Examples:
1. Given A = [0, 4, -1, 0, 3] and B = [0, -2, 5, 0, 3], your function should return 2. The fair indexes are 3 and 4. 
In both cases, the sums of elements of the subarrays are equal to 3.
2. Given A = [2, -2, -3, 3] and B = [0, 0, 4, -4], your function should return 1. The only fair index is 2. 
Index 4 is not fair as the subarrays containing indexes from K to N - 1 would be empty.
3. Given A = [4, -1, 0, 3] and B = [-2, 6, 0, 4], your function should return 0. There are no fair indexes.
4. Given A = [3, 2, 6] and B = [4, 1, 6], your function should return 0.
5. Given A = [1, 4, 2, -2, 5], B = [7, -2, -2, 2, 5], your function should return 2. The fair indexes are 2 and 4.
